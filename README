Tikona-Login
============

A simple script that you can fire to log you into Tikona network. I agree, their
login UI is a perfect example of how horrible a webpage can look. Put this
script in your ~/bin folder (or somewhere), set up alias properly, and next time
you want to log in, just execute this script.

This script does not use any 3rd party library, so it should work out of the
box.

Usage
=====

python tikona-login.py <account_id> <password>



Set up Alias
============
Put this line in the shell specific startup file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc..)

alias tikona-login="python /path/to/tikona-login.py <account_id> <pwd>"


Ohh, and BTW, I am just fine with putting my password like that. YMMV. :)
